  description: |
    This release switches from using `requests` to `httpx` for making http
    requests, and from threads to `asyncio` for concurrency. This enables
    easier implementation of new features, but has no breaking changes for the
    CLI.
  changes:
    - "**BREAKING**: Require Python 3.7 or later."
    - "Add `--rate-limit` option to `download` for limiting maximum bandwidth when downloading."
    - "Add `--compact` option to `download` for displaying one video per line."
    - "Allow passing multiple video ids to `download` to download multiple videos successively."
    - "Improved progress meter, updates on each chunk downloaded, instead of each VOD downloaded."
    - "Improved speed estimate, displays recent speed instead of average speed since the start of download."
    - |
      Decreased default concurrent downloads to 5. This seems to be enough to
      saturate the download link in most cases. You can override this by setting
      the `-w` option. Please test and report back if this works for you.
