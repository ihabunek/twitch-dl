and from threads to `asyncio` for concurrency. This enables easier
implementation of new features, but has no breaking changes for the CLI.

  successively.

  downloaded.

  the start of download.
* Decreased default concurrent downloads to 5. This seems to be enough to
  saturate the download link in most cases. You can override this by setting the
  `-w` option. Please test and report back if this works for you.
