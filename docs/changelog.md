### [2.0.0 (TBA)](https://github.com/ihabunek/twitch-dl/releases/tag/2.0.0)

This release switches from using `requests` to `httpx` for making http requests,
and from threads to `asyncio` for concurrency. This enables easier
implementation of new features, but has no breaking changes for the CLI.

* **BREAKING**: Require Python 3.7 or later.
* Add `--rate-limit` option to `download` for limiting maximum bandwidth when
  downloading.
* Allow passing multiple video ids to `download` to download multiple videos
  successively.
* Improved progress meter, updates on each chunk downloaded, instead of each VOD
  downloaded.
* Improved speed estimate, displays recent speed instead of average speed since
  the start of download.
* Decreased default concurrent downloads to 5. This seems to be enough to
  saturate the download link in most cases. You can override this by setting the
  `-w` option. Please test and report back if this works for you.
